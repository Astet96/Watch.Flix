    for that movie/show, as well as the associated poster (if any).</p>

    <p>If no titles are found that satisfy the search criteria, then an apology is rendered.</p>

    <p>Finally, there is a history tab, presenting the titles (as links to IMdb pages) of the most recent 10 search results.</p>
